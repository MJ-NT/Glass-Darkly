    <p class="mb-3">
        I, the creator (hello, it's me, Matt), am a huge fan of both games, and I wanted to create an homage of sorts to Harry Tuffs' Herculean labour of love.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
        You, the player character, are a 'visitant', a being stolen from another world by the parasite dimension that is the 'House'. It is a mad, disturbing sprawl of wonders and terrors, but you don't have time to worry about all that right now.
        Plucked from the fantastic dark only to be pitched through a mirror and set adrift in a kaleidoscopic dimension, you are propelled through the House as blood quickened by the heart.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
        Find the next mirror. Delve ever deeper. Do not look back.
